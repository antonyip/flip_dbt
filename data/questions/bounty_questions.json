Now that protocol governance is live, these decisions are in the hands of the community - SBR token holders. In order to cast votes for which pool(s) should receive rewards (via the ‚Äúgauges‚Äù), users must lock SBR tokens to receive voting escrowed Saber - veSBR. Locking SBR for longer periods (5yr maximum) grants the token holder more voting power - more say in which liquidity pool gets the most SBR rewards.\n\nOnce votes are cast and the next epoch begins, the new rewards distribution is applied to the liquidity pools. 1 epoch = 1 calendar week. As of 24 February 2022, close to 40% of the total SBR token supply is locked in protocol Governance.\n\nFor more information on the Voting Escrow System, please see the Tribeca documentation : https://docs.tribeca.so/voting-escrow\n\nWhat was the total supply of veSBR at the end of each of the last two Epochs (4 & 5)?

Liquidity providers earn yield in the form of the protocol‚Äôs native SBR token. Until recently, the core development team set the reward allocations for each liquidity pool. Now that protocol governance is live, these decisions are in the hands of the community - SBR token holders. In order to cast votes for which pool(s) should receive rewards (via the ‚Äúgauges‚Äù), users must lock SBR tokens to receive voting escrowed Saber - veSBR. Locking SBR for longer periods (5yr maximum) grants the token holder more voting power - more say in which liquidity pool gets the most SBR rewards.\n\nOnce votes are cast and the next epoch begins, the new rewards distribution is applied to the liquidity pools. 1 epoch = 1 calendar week. As of March 3, 2022, nearly 38% of the total SBR token supply is locked in protocol Governance.\n\nFor more information on the Voting Escrow System, please see the Tribeca documentation : https://docs.tribeca.so/voting-escrow\n\nCreate a time series analysis of Saber locked up over time, noting the start of each epoch. List the top 20 wallets that have locked Saber in the month of February. Have these top wallets added to their locked SBR positions to gain even more voting power, or do they lock all their SBR tokens in governance at once? What other activities are these top 20 wallets doing in the month of February (for example what other tokens are they transacting with, what other protocols are they engaging with)?\n\nHint (Locker): https://solscan.io/tx/5m3cXquqMncfCgEArC5AHnoZMYUckPzJcJ3FFDhiEuDjBNRB9odCmVDygBk22C7AivGMF4yM157NaPbpR3ekkebH\n\nHint (Gauges): https://solscan.io/tx/5ScNj5VwbuV5ahx1WwnW82F6BfAXXQhppgnj3wtJqWAqFs4W4p6LvcF2Zx4G4hTJbbQuKamaSn3Tgcios8xEGKUW",
